# hangman_game
a simple "hangman" game

A hangman game that uses 2 lists (web-scrapped with the jupyter notebook file) to defy the player. It chooses a word inside this two lists, and hides its letters, asking the player to guess it, one by one.

The game's objective is to guess the word with 5 errors max. In the sixty error, you lose.

I let the .ipynb file here just to show how the lists were created.
